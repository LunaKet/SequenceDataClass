# Sequence Data
In this published work, the data was composed of previously processed spontaneous cortical activity in the developing visual cortex. Briefly, raw calcium imaging was z-scored (Î”F/F0), deconvolved using numerical differentiation, and segmented into temporal series of arbitrary duration.

*Stereotyped spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous activity in visual cortex prior to eye-opening.

## Sequence Class
[/SequenceLoadingClass](https://github.com/LunaKet/SequenceDataClass/blob/master/SequenceLoadingClass.py)  
One hurdle to analyzing this data was the arbitrary duration, where most data fell between 40ms-200ms. A NumPy array would not be appropriate since the durations are different. Thus, a list was used, but lists can be clunky to index and slice. This repository contains a custom class to manage this data, with slicing functionality that mimics NumPy. i.e., a series of indices can be used, or colon syntax can be used.

> seq_firstHundred = sequences.Seqs[0:100]

## Sequence Loading
[/SequenceLoadingFunctions](https://github.com/LunaKet/SequenceDataClass/blob/master/SequenceLoadingFunctions.py)  
The underlying data is around 1 Terabyte per animal, so care was taken to load in data in batches and to minimize data in memory. That being said, the dataset *is* big and not easily accesbile, so for now this script is only a demonstration and cannot be run.

## Sequence Metrics and Greedy Groups
[/SequenceMetrics](https://github.com/LunaKet/SequenceDataClass/blob/master/SequenceMetrics.py)  
This script calculates many intermediary and key metrics for a sequence, allowing comparison across a range of durations.

[/GreedyGroups](https://github.com/LunaKet/SequenceDataClass/blob/master/GreedyGroups.py)  
This clusters the data according to a Greedy algorithm. It is based on sequence correlations, using a shuffled control to determine the threshold for a significantly correlated pair of sequences.
